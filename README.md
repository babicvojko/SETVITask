# SETVITask

# Instructions before launching app
- be sure that all Package Dependencies are installed

# Setting up test account
- during development I use my own API access token, but unfortunately it can't be a part of source code because GitHub recognize it in code and after that revoke it immediately. I will provide my test API token in mail, but you can also use other api token generated by yourself
- setup API token in GitHubCoreServerDefinition, inside headers method

# Notes
- repository pattern is used for networking layer, but keyword repository is widely used here for naming bussines and network objects. It may looks confusing at the first glance when see a lot of repositories
